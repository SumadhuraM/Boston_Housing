# 🏠 Boston Housing Price Prediction

A **Python machine learning project** to predict Boston housing prices. Easily **train, test, and run predictions** using prepared scripts and notebooks.

---

##  Features

- Train multiple regression models (Linear Regression, etc.)  
- Save and load trained models (`.pkl`) for quick predictions  
- Predict housing prices using Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks  
- Explore dataset and model performance in notebooks  
- Clean and organized project structure
